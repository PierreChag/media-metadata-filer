# Media Metadata Filer
Many website like WhatsApp use a compression system that deletes the metadatas of medias sent. In the case of the pictures and videos, it can be quite painful because they can not be order by date in Windows Explorer for example. If these metadata can not be recreated from nothing, we can assess that the date of creation of the media is often the same than the date at which the picture was taken.

This scripts allows the user to select a folder and 2 metadata fields (the one to copy and the one to fill if it does not contain any information). When the script is run, a little window will open where the user chose the folder. Then, after validating, all the files in the folder that contains the corresponding metadata parameter will receive the modification.
